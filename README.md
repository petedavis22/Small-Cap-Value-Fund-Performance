# Small-Cap-Value-Fund-Performance
I worked with a group of 5 to analysis performance of small-cap value mutual funds in Python. We utilized the CRSP database from WRDS (Wharton Research Data Services). 

Our report is written up under the file name 'Homework 2 Report'. 

Our code is under the file name 'Homework 2 - Small-Cap Value Performance.ipynb'.
